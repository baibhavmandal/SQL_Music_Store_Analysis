# SQL Music Store Analysis

Welcome to the SQL Music Store Analysis Project!

In this project, I have analyzed a music store's database using SQL queries to gain insights into their sales data. The following are the questions we have answered through our SQL queries:

Q1: Who is the senior most employee based on job title?

Q2: Which countries have the most Invoices?

Q3: What are top 3 values of total invoices?

Q4: Which city has the best customers? We would like to throw a promotional Music Festival in the city we made the most money. Write a query that returns one city that has highest sum of invoice totals. Return both the city name & sum of all invoice totals.

Q5: Who is the best customer? The customer who has spent the most money wiil be declared the best customer. Write a query that returns the person who has spent the most money
What is the average revenue per customer?

Q6: Write query to return the email , first name, last name, and genre of all rocks music listeners. Return your list ordered alphabetically email starting with A.

Q7: Let's invite the artist who have written the most rock music in our dataset. Write a query that returns the Artist name and total track count of the top 10 rock bands.

Q8: Return all the track names that have a song length longer than the average song length. Return the Name and Milliseconds for each track. Order by the song length with the longest songs listed first.

Q9: Find how much amount spent by each customer artist? Write a query to return customer, artist name and total spen

I have used various SQL functions, such as SUM, GROUP BY, JOIN, and AVG, to perform the required calculations and obtain the necessary information.

Feel free to explore my SQL queries and analysis in the repository and use them as a reference for your own data analysis projects. Let's dive into the world of SQL data analysis and unlock valuable insights!
